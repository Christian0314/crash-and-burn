                This is a program that we wrote during Howdy Hack. 
                It is a piano that you can play by pushing keys on
                your keyboard. We also made songs that you can play
                some notes in it and it will start playing the song for you.

                Instructions: Press 'PIANO' to play around with a mini musical keyboard! 
                Learn to play two songs by clicking the tabs at the top, or play whatever notes you want with free play! Enjoy!
